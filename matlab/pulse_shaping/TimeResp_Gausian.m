%function [TimeResp, Times, FreqResp, Freqs] = TimeResp_Gausian(SymbolFs, BT, Ts, Duration, Fs, MaxFreq)
% generate the impulse response (and freq. resp.) of a gausian pulse shaping filter
% and the freq. response
%
% SymbolFs: data rate (e.g. = 1e6)
% BT : Gaussian BT (B*SymbolTs, where B = 3dB BW of the filter (between DC and B), SymbolTs = 1/SymbolFs) (e.g. 0.5)
%
% For the time response:
% Duration: impulse response duration (e.g. 8*1/SymbolFs)
% Ts: impulse response sampling resolution (e.g. 1/80 * 1/SymbolFs)
%
% For the frequency response: Note that this is the response of a *continous* exponential, the produced exponential will have a different response as it is not infinitely oversampled == its response is aliased == flatter.
% Fs: frequency response sampling resolution (e.g. SymbolFs/10)
% MaxFreq: the response will be generated in -MaxFreq:Fs:MaxFreq
